A modified version of the `v` test environment, which uses the rvcpp TB IO
(same as Hazard3 TB IO) to control exit and pass/fail of tests. The ISA test
Makefile has been modified to:

- Use this environment instead of the v environment
- Generate .bin files, to avoid requiring the simulator to embed an ELF
  loader (note rvcpp is meant to be drop-in compatible with simple
  CXXRTL/verilator harnesses of real cores)
- Map TB IO for use by S/U mode with virtual memory enabled

This directory contains modified copies of riscv_test.h and vm.c to support
this. The other files are symlinked to the upstream ones in ../env/v, because
they did not require modification.
