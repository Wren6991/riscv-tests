A modified version of the `p` test environment, which uses the rvcpp TB IO
(same as Hazard3 TB IO) to control exit and pass/fail of tests. The ISA test
Makefile has been modified to:

- Use this environment instead of the p environment
- Generate .bin files, to avoid requiring the simulator to embed an ELF
  loader (note rvcpp is meant to be drop-in compatible with simple
  CXXRTL/verilator harnesses of real cores)
