A modified version of the `p` test environment, suitable for the memory map of
the Hazard3 testbench, and using Hazard3 testbench IO to quit with a
pass/fail return code.

The ISA test Makefile has been modified to:

- Use this environment instead of the p environment
- Generate .bin files, as the Hazard3 testbench does not have a built-in ELF
  loader.
